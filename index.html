  <h1>Scott's JavaScript 30 Day Challenge</h1>
  Hi! Thanks for stopping by. This is my repo for Wes Bos' JavaScript 30 Challenge, where we write 30 projects in 30 days. I started this project series on April 1st, 2020. 
  <br>
  As my projects get completed, I will add them here and you can see my progress as I go along.
