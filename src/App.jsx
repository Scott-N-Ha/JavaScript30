      <p>
        Hi! Thanks for stopping by. This is my repo for Wes Bos' JavaScript 30 Challenge, where we write 30 projects in 30 days. I started this project series on April 1st, 2020.
        <br />
        As my projects get completed, I will add them here and you can see my progress as I go along.
